# ChatGPT
Summary

In this project chatGPT is used inside of a python file to answer questions entered by the user. An outside file is passed as information into the program and using the information in the file chatGPT can answer the users questions. The program allows the user to keep inputting questions and chatGPT will generate a response until the user chooses to exit out of the loop. The goal of this project was to pass information in a file to chatGPT and get answers based on what was in the file.




Implementation

When you run the program GPT will take the provided article as input and you will be able to ask any question you want, and responses will be generated within the specified token limit. Once you are done asking questions you can hit q to exit the program.
